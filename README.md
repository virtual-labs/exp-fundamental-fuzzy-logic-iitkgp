### About the Experiment 

Fuzzy logic was developed by Lotfi A. Zadeh in the 1960s in order to provide mathematical rules and functions which permitted natural language queries. Fuzzy logic provides a means of calculating intermediate values between absolute true and absolute false with resulting values ranging between 0.0 and 1.0. With fuzzy logic, it is possible to calculate the degree to which an item is a member. For example, if a person is .83 of tallness, they are " rather tall. " Fuzzy logic calculates the shades of gray between black/white and true/false.

Fuzzy logic is a super set of conventional (or Boolean) logic and contains similarities and differences with Boolean logic. Fuzzy logic is similar to Boolean logic, in that Boolean logic results are returned by fuzzy logic operations when all fuzzy memberships are restricted to 0 and 1. Fuzzy logic differs from Boolean logic in that it is permissive of natural language queries and is more like human thinking; it is based on degrees of truth.

The graphical representation of fuzzy and boolean sets are different as well.
